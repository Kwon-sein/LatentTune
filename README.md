LatentTune: Efficient Tuning of High Dimensional Database Parameters via Latent Representation Learning


🥳 Accepted at **2025 IEEE 32nd International Conference on High Performance Computing, Data, and Analytics (HiPC 2025)** 🥳


Modern DBMS tuning is limited by expensive data collection, subset-only tuning in high-dimensional spaces, and reliance on similar workloads. LatentTune addresses these by **(i) augmenting training data, (ii) compressing all parameters into a latent space** to optimize the full configuration, and **(iii) injecting target workload metrics** for precise, workload-specific tuning. Experimental results demonstrate that LatentTune outperforms baseline models across four workloads on MySQL and RocksDB, achieving up to **1332% improvement for RocksDB** and **11.82% throughput gain with 46.01% latency reduction for MySQL**.
